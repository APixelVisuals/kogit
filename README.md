2. Click on [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps)
3. Click on [Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
4. Click `Generate New Token` (GitHub might prompt you to enter your password)
5. Enable the `repo` scope
6. Click `Generate Token` at the bottom
7. Copy your new access token and run the Kogit command with the `-t` or `--token` flag:
```
$ kogit -t ACCESS_TOKEN
```
